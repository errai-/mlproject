rankVote.m: determines the ranking using random forest and slightly a neural
network
tester.m: a slow script for testing the success of the method in training
dataset

Primary ideas:

tree.m: random forest

nn.m: neural network

moar.m: a script for determining a and b for the voting between tree and nn

Failed ideas:
kNNrank.m, kNNWines.m, classif.m, varDist.m:
kNN-related things

discrRank.m, discrRankQuadr.m: discriminative ranking

gaussWines.m, logDiscrGauss.m: ranking assuming gaussian behavior

somap.m: self-organizing map

svm.m: support vector machine

oldlike.m: likelihood-things
