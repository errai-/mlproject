colorVoter.m: A final script for determining the color in test dataset
colorVoterRef.m: A script for testing the methods using only the training data
These use voting - kNN, logistic discrimination, random forest

The three methods separately:
discrWines.m: logistic discrimination
like.m: logistic likelihood and its derivative

tree.m: random forest

realkNNWines.m: naive kNN
varDist.m: calculates normalized distance

Others:
naiveWines.m: naive discrimination using only the density, Gaussian
gaussWines.m: naive discrimination, using all parameters (assumed Gaussian)
logDiscrGauss.m: discriminant for the gaussian discr.
logDiscrNaive.m: discriminant for the naive discr.
